<h1>Arrow Function</h1>

<h2>Implicit Return</h2>

<p>The arrow function expects a return value, and returns the value by default, without the <strong>return</strong> keyword.</p>
The following works the same way as the previous example, but without the <strong>return</strong> keyword and without the curly braces.  
In my opinion, this model is more error-prone and obfuscated,
although this is the in-vogue methodology that all the cool people are using.

<p id="demo"></p>
  
<script>
hello = () => "Hello World!";

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = hello();
</script>

</body>
</html>
